# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#I also determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity.
SELECT track_name
,artist_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#I then wanted to see if there might be a relationship between tempo and chart ranking.
SELECT id
,popularity
,artist_name
,track_name
,CAST(tempo as int) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY length(id);

#Since chart ranking and popularity are different metrics, I also wanted to see the relationship between popularity and tempo. 
SELECT popularity
,artist_name
,track_name
,CAST(tempo as int)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc;

#I also devised a way to look at the *amount* of songs that fell within each of the classical tempo classifications.
SELECT count(id),
    CASE 
    WHEN CAST(tempo as int) between 40 and 60 THEN "largo"
    WHEN CAST(tempo as int) between 61 and 76 THEN "adagio"
    WHEN CAST(tempo as int) between 77 and 108 THEN "andante"
    WHEN CAST(tempo as int) between 109 and 120 THEN "moderato"
    WHEN CAST(tempo as int) between 121 and 168 THEN "allegro"
    WHEN CAST(tempo as int) between 169 and 200 THEN "presto"
    END as "tempo_classification"
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY tempo_classification;

#I wanted to also see the proportion of songs that could be classified as being in either a major(0) or minor(1) tonality.
SELECT mode
,COUNT(mode)as total_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY mode;

#I devised a way to look at the amount of songs that were written in each of the 12 possible keys.
Select count(id)
,key
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY key
ORDER BY count(id) asc;

#I determined the number of times each artist appeared in the charts. 
SELECT artist_name
,count(artist_name) as frequency
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY frequency desc;

#I also wanted to see whether there was a relationship between song length, popularity, and ranking. 
SELECT artist_name
,track_name
,duration_ms
,id
,popularity

ORDER BY duration_ms desc;

#I then determined the top 10 artists by average popularity.
